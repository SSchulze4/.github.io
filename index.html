      <p>There are a few topics I would like to cover that I believe would be very useful to help someone get to know me. Those topics will be the books I like to read, the games I love to play, and finally the media I watch. You can find each under its own link in the navigation menu near the bottom of the page. Before then I would like to quickly list out some information that does not neatly fit under those categories.</p>
