      <p>There are a few topics I would like to cover that I believe
        would be very useful to help someone get to know me. Those topics
        will be the books I like to read, the games I love to play, and
        finally the media I watch. You can find each under its own link in
        the navigation menu near the bottom of the page.</p>
